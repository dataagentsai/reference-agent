# TODO

Work identified by review questions and **not yet started**. Nothing here is in
progress; this is the queue.

Findings that are already defects live in [`evals/FINDINGS.md`](evals/FINDINGS.md),
and the questions that produced them in [`REVIEW.md`](REVIEW.md). This file is for
work that is *missing* rather than *wrong* — the difference matters, because a
missing capability has no failing test to point at and will otherwise be
forgotten.

Each item names **what** is missing, **why it matters**, and **where** it would
land, because an item that says only "add X" gets re-argued every time it is
read.

## T-001 · Nothing happens when the chat opens

**Status** Not started. Raised 2026-09-05.

**What is missing.** The customer clicks *Talk to our AI agent*, a box opens, and
it is empty. There is no greeting, no list of their orders, nothing about work
already in flight. The only route that does anything is `POST /chat`, and it
requires text — so **a session opening is not expressible at all**: it is an
entry point that is not a message.

**Why it matters.** Three reasons, in order of weight.

*The customer has to know their order number.* Every scenario in the suite opens
with a customer who conveniently types `AB-10003`. Real ones do not have it to
hand, so the first two turns of every real conversation are spent establishing
which order — turns that cost money and that a list of three orders would have
skipped entirely.

*Work already in flight is invisible.* A refund waiting on a colleague, a return
part-way through — the agent holds all of it and the customer sees none of it
until they ask. `pending_approval_id` is already on the conversation and nothing
surfaces it.

*It is the cheapest possible turn and we are not taking it.* Listing somebody's
own orders is a database read. Greeting them by name is a string. **Opening a
chat should cost zero model calls**, and a product that generates its greeting
with the model pays for every abandoned open — which is most opens.

**Where it lands.**

- `serve` — a new `GET /session` returning who you are, your recent orders, and
  anything outstanding. Same identity check as `/chat`; the check being easy to
  forget on a read-only route is exactly why it needs its own test.
- `ui` — fetch it on load and render it; make the orders clickable so the
  customer picks rather than types.
- The world already has everything needed. No new tool: `get_order` exists, and
  a `list_orders` action would be four lines of YAML.

**What it must not become.** A model call. The router's whole point is that a
question with a deterministic answer never reaches the model, and *"what are my
orders"* is the most deterministic question there is.

**What to be careful of.**

- *Another customer's orders.* The identity check on a read-only endpoint is the
  one people skip.
- *A greeting that claims something untrue.* "Your refund has been processed"
  when it has not is the same failure class the truth oracle exists for, and it
  would now happen **before the customer has typed anything**.
- *Stale data.* Orders listed at open, acted on a minute later — the same
  check-then-act window `StaleRead` already models, moved to a place nothing
  currently tests.

**AgentTwin needs it too.** A scenario begins with an actor saying something.
There is no way to express *"the customer opened the chat and saw this"*, so the
opening state a real conversation starts from cannot be simulated. Both sides
have the same gap.
